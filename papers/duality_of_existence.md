Let us observe two things $$A$$ and $$B$$. Now suppose these are the only things to observe. We would say that there doesn't exist more than $$A$$ and $$B$$, but how could we describe existence?

$$A$$ is simply $$A$$ and $$B$$ is simply $$B$$? We observe both things in relation to each other, to differentiate and then individualize. $$A$$ cannot simply be $$A$$ for itself. $$A$$ is here because it is not $$B$$ and $$B$$ is there because it is not $$A$$. $$A$$ and $$B$$ exist via their relation to each other. $$A$$ for itself would have to mean an absolute thing, which is equivalent to no thing. Without demarcation the needed contrast to observe any thing would be missing.

For $$A$$ to exist, we already needed $$B$$ and vice versa.
$$A$$ and $$B$$ are not possibly in relation, but inevitably. We cannot isolate an identity to designate an individual, $$A$$ or $$B$$.
We can conclude that everything what exists is defined by what it exclusively is not.
Moreover the chain of existence cannot start with a single absolute thing, which wouldn't be differentiable from no thing. It has to start with a multitude of things in relation.

*Duality of existence* holds an explanation for Wave-particle duality on a philosophical level. The wave might be a witness for the existence of the particle and vice versa.

The identity of any thing depends on all other things. Therefore I do not know who I am, but suspect who I am not.
