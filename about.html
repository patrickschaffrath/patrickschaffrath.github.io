  <p>Hello, this is Patrick!</p>
  <p>
    I like to combine art and science, not forgetting about the root of all -
    philosophy. This space contains some of those combinations in form of
    stories, photos and artistically scientific writings. Enjoy!

    let email = user + "@" + domain;
    let mailtoLink = "mailto:" + email;

    let emailElement = document.getElementById("email-link");
    emailElement.href = mailtoLink;
